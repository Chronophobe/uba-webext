# UBA Linker

Opens a new tab for the current page using the [uba.uva.nl](http://uba.uva.nl) webproxy (requires login using UvA ID).

## Installation (firefox)
1. Download the `.xpi`-file from the `release/` folder.
2. Go to `Tools > Add-ons`
3. Click the little gear icon
4. Select `Install Add-on From File...`
5. Navigate to and select your freshly downloaded `.xpi`-file.

## TODO:
* ~~Port to Chrome~~
* Maybe make it more generic and configurable to work with other webproxies too.
